## Overview
The Text Encryption App is a simple Python application that allows users to encrypt and decrypt text using a password of their choice. The app is built using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface and utilizes basic encryption techniques to secure the input text.

## Features
User-Friendly Interface: The app provides a straightforward and easy-to-use graphical interface for both encryption and decryption.

Customizable Password: Users can set their own password for encrypting and decrypting text, providing an additional layer of security.

Text Encryption: The app employs a basic encryption algorithm to transform the input text into a secure, encrypted format.

Text Decryption: Users can decrypt the encrypted text using the same password that was used for encryption.

## Installation
download the .exe file and open it

The application window will appear, allowing you to input text and set a password for encryption.

Click the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the text using the provided password.

To decrypt the text, enter the encrypted text and the same password used for encryption. Click the "Decrypt" button.


## Security Considerations
Choose a Strong Password: It is essential to choose a strong and secure password to ensure the integrity of the encryption.

Keep Password Confidential: Do not share the password used for encryption with unauthorized individuals.

Regularly Update Password: Consider updating the encryption password regularly for enhanced security.
